# ReVanced Magisk (edited by [me](https://github.com/yxngazvest), original by [j-hc](https://github.com/j-hc))
[![Build Modules](https://github.com/yxngazvest/revanced-magisk/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yxngazvest/revanced-magisk/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This repo includes a simple script that downloads all the latest version of necessary prebuilt revanced tools and build patched apps. You don't need to download a script and do everything, this repository was created to "help" others so they wouldn't have to do it ;P

You can get the [latest CI release from here](https://github.com/yxngazvest/revanced-magisk/releases).

The [**mindetach module**](https://github.com/j-hc/mindetach-magisk) in the releases section detaches YouTube and YouTube Music from Play Store and blocks it from updating them.

## Installation
 * Simply flash the module, you do not need to install YouTube or Music beforehand. Everything is handled by the module.
 * No need for a reboot after the installation. YouTube or Music will be mounted immediately.
 * x86 and x86_64 arches are not supported!

## Updating
The modules support Magisk update which means you will receive updates from your Magisk app, downloading from github releases and reflashing is not necessary.
